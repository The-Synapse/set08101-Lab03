		 When baking a cheesecake, it is important not to over bake it. You only want to
bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle, not until it is rock solid.
	</p>
	<p> It is important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure
even baking of your cheesecake.</p>
	<aside>
	 To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water
that goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed.
